>>Which of the following will cause the shortest execution of a binary search looking for a value in an array of integers sorted in ascending order? 
Assume that the array has an odd number of integers. <<

(x) The value is in the middle of the array. {{Correct because a binary search starts at the middle of the array when searching for a value.}}
( ) The value is in the first element of the array. {{Incorrect because it would take a couple of executions of the loop before the first element is checked.}}
( ) The value is in the last element of the array. {{Incorrect because it would take a couple of executions of the loop before the last element is checked.}}
( ) The value is not in the array. {{Incorrect because this will take the longest execution time for any binary search.}}
( ) All of the executions should take the same amount of time. {{Incorrect because a binary search starts at the middle of the array and cannot check the whole array at once.}}

||Binary search starts from the middle of the array and makes its way towards the target value. ||
