Insertion sort is a more efficient type of sort as it passes through an array only once and puts each element in its correct location as it is analyzed. This method is similar to organizing a handful of playing cards where you pick up each card and insert it into its correct position in your hand of organized cards. Insertion sort divides the array or `ArrayList` into two sub-arrays; one is always sorted and increases in size as the sort continues, like the organized cards in your hand. The second sub-array is unsorted and contains all the elements yet to be inserted into the first sub-array, like the random cards you are picking up. The second sub-array decreases in size as the sort goes on, while the first sub-array increases in size. Let's take a look at the insertion sort below.
