>>Consider the following selection sort method:

```
public void selectionSort(int[] paramOne){
  for (int j = 0; j &lt; paramOne.length-1; j++){
    int m = j;
    for (int k = j + 1; k &lt; paramOne.length; k++){
      if (paramOne[k] &lt; paramOne[m]){
        m = k;
      }
    }
    int temp = paramOne[m];  
    paramOne[m] = paramOne[j];
    paramOne[j] = temp;
    /* End of outer loop */
  }
}
```

<p>Assume that <code>selectionSort</code> is called with the array {6, 3, 2, 5, 4, 1}. What will the value of <code>paramOne</code> be after three passes of the outer loop (i.e., when j = 2 at the point indicated by /* End of outer loop */)?</p><<

||Selection sort finds the smallest value in the array as it proceeds and switches them to the front end of the array. ||
