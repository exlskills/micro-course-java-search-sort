There are two loops in a selection sort. The inner loop finds the next smallest or largest value while the outer loop places that value into its proper location. Although selection sort is one of the easier sorts to code, it is also fairly inefficient as there is no way you can end the sort early, even if the list is already sorted. No matter what the state of the list is, the selection sort will go through each index, starting with zero, and sort each element through to the end.
