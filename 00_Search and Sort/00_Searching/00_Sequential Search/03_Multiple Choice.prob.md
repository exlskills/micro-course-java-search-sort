>>Which of the following will cause the longest execution of a sequential search looking for a value in an array of 100 integers? <<

( ) The value is in the first element of the array. {{Incorrect because it would only take 1 execution of the loop before the program returns the position of the value.}}
( ) The value is in the middle of the array. {{Incorrect because it would take 50 executions of the loop before the program returns the position of the value.}}
( ) The value is in the second last element of the array. {{Incorrect because it would take 99 executions of the loop before the program returns the position of the value.}}
(x)  The value is not in the array. {{Correct because it would take 100 executions of the loop before the program returns the position of the value.}}
( ) All of the executions should take the same amount of time. {{Incorrect because sequential search cannot search the whole array at once.}}

||Sequential search starts from the first element of the array and searches all the way to the last element in order. ||
