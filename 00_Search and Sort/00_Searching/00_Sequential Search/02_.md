The sequential search uses a concept we have already mastered, `for` or `while` loops that search for a specified integer in an array. The concept is called "sequential search" as it goes through the elements starting from the first one, indexed "0", all the way through to the final index. Once the search runs, it returns the index of the targeted value if the targeted value exists in the array. This search functionality can be used on any type of "array" or `ArrayList`, but it may not be your preferred way of searching once you learn about other search methods in the future.
