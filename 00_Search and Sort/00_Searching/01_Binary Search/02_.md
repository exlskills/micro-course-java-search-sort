Again, a binary search will only work if we have a sorted list. Duplicate values don't affect the search. A binary search starts at the middle of a sorted list and assess if the value it's called to look for is greater than of less than the middle. This initial procedure establishes whether the target value is in the first or second half of the list, at which point the search changes its high and low values to focus on the correct half of the list. Then, the search enters the middle of its chosen half and does the exact same procedure over and over again until the target value is found.

Although you will not need to know how to write your own search methods, you do have to understand what a search method does and how it works in order to use them effectively.
